# 2022 Tech Optimum Hackathon

This is our 2022 Tech Optimum Hackathon Project. We created and founded the *Nexus Travel App*. Our inspiration to this was our love of travel. It does multiple things such as allow users to **lookup info about countries**, log in to **save preferences**, and **locate the ideal travel destination based off of their interests**. We built it using **Firebase** as our backend and **React** as our front-end. Challenges that we ran into are . Accomplishments that we are proud of are that we used Firebase to keep a database of log ins and their respictive preferences. We are going to continue to improve and refine our website to make it as best as it can possibly be.
